# Unified Arsenal GUI Texture Note
# 
# This file serves as a placeholder for the unified_arsenal.png texture
# The texture should be 256x256 pixels with the following layout:
# 
# Main GUI Background (176x166):
# - Standard inventory GUI background
# - Arsenal slot areas for extra hands
# 
# Slot Background (18x18) at position 176,0:
# - Empty slot background for arsenal slots
# 
# Until a proper texture is created, the game will use the default
# missing texture (purple/black checkerboard) which is acceptable
# for testing functionality.
#
# The GUI will still function correctly without the custom texture.
