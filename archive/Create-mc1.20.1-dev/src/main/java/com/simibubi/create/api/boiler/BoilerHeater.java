/**
 * A BoilerHeater provides heat to boilers.
 * Boilers will query blocks for heaters through the registry, usually with {@link #findHeat(Level, BlockPos, BlockState) findHeat}.
 * Heaters can provide a heat level by returning any positive integer from their {@link #getHeat(Level, BlockPos, BlockState) getHeat} method.
 * Returning any negative number counts as no heat - {@link #NO_HEAT} is provided for convenience.
 * <p>
 * Returning {@link #PASSIVE_HEAT} is special - passive heat can be used to provide a small amount of heat, highly limiting
 * in its abilities. This is usually used for free sources of heat, such as fire or magma blocks.
