/**
 * One person walking sounds like one person walking, and you can easily distinguish where they are.
 *
 * <br>With two people walking, you can still pick out which footsteps belong to which person.
 *
 * <br>Try and listen to three people walking in a group, however, and you'll find that you can't distinguish
 * individual footsteps anymore. You now just hear the sound of a group of people walking.
 *
 * <p>You'll likely find that you perceive any number of people walking in a group as a single distinguishable sound.
 * This class is a helper to take advantage of that for sound effects in Create to avoid saturating the sound engine
 * without a perceptible loss in quality.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: It's up to the user of this class to decide how to group sounds such that they are perceived as a single
 * sound. There are no spatial calculations made here.
